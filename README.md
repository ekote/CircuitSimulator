# CircuitSimulator

Simple project developed on the course of Graphical User Interface Design on Electrical Engineering bachelor 
studies at Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.

1. The goal of the project is to provide a graphical user interface for NGSpice project (for reduced number of 
electrical components).
2. The project is written in Java Swing.

The main scenario of the programme is:

1. User edits the electrical circuit visually layouting its component and connections.
2. User presses Start simulation.
3. The programme generates NGSpice script.
4. The programme executes the script in NGSpice saving results in a text file.
5. The programme presents the results in a graphical plot.
